##US National Park Improvements

This webpage was a project to learn how to do asynchronous processing and API calls.  It executes an API call to the Whitehouse open data page [here] (https://open.whitehouse.gov/).

I also used [Leaflet] (http://leafletjs.com/) and [Mapbox] (https://www.mapbox.com/) to display the data I found on the page and to zoom to the selected state.  

The dropdown auto-complete selection box uses the [Awesomplete] (http://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/) widget, which was super easy to get up and running and looks and works great.
